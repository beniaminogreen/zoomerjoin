Description: Zoomerjoin empowers users to fuzzily-merge dataframes with millions or tens of millions of rows in minuites with low memory usage.  The package uses the MinHash algorithm invented by Broder (1997) <doi:10.1109/SEQUEN.1997.666900> to avoid having to compare every pair of records in each dataset, resulting in fuzzy-merges that finish in linear time.  As a secondary feature, the package also wraps the rust kdtree crate to provide euclidian-distance joins that finish in linearithmic time.
