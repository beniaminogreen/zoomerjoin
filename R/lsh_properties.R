#' Help Choose the Appropriate LSH Hyperparameters
#'
#' Runs a grid search to find the hyperparameters that will achieve an
#' (s1,s2,p1,p2)-sensitive locality sensitive hash. A locality sensitive hash
#' can be called (s1,s2,p1,p2)-sensitive if to strings with a similarity less
#' than s1 have a less than p1 chance of being compared, while two strings with
#' similarity s2 have a greater than p2 chance of being compared. As an
#' example, a (.1,.7,.001,.999)-sensitive LSH means that strings with
#' similarity less than .1 will have a .1% chance of being compared, while
#' strings with .7 similarity have a 99.9% chance of being compared.
#'
#' @param s1  the s1 parameter (the first similaity).
#' @param s2  the s2 parameter (the second similarity, must be greater than s1).
#' @param p1  the p1 parameter (the first probability).
#' @param p2  the p2 parameter (the second probability, must be greater than p1).
#'
#' @return a named vector with the hyperparameters that will meet the LSH
#' criteria, while reducing runitme.
