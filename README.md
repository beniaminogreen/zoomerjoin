zoomerjoin is an R package that empowers you to fuzzy-join massive
datasets rapidly, and with little memory consumption. It is powered by
high-performance implementations of [Locality Sensitive
Hashing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locality-sensitive_hashing), an
algorithm that finds the matches records between two datasets without
having to compare all possible pairs of observations. In practice, this
means zoomerjoin can fuzzily-join datasets days, or even years faster
than other matching packages. zoomerjoin has been used in-production to
join datasets of hundreds of millions of names or vectors in a matter of
hours.

## Installation

### Installing from CRAN:

You can install from the CRAN as you would with any other package.
Please be aware that you will have to have Cargo (the rust toolchain and
compiler) installed to build the package from source.

``` r
install.packages(zoomerjoin)
```

### Installing from R-Universe:

This package is distributed using
[r-universe](https://r-universe.dev/search/), which provides
pre-compiled binaries for common operating systems and recent versions
of R. To install with r-universe, you can use the following command in
R:

``` r
install.packages(
  'zoomerjoin',
  repos = c('https://beniaminogreen.r-universe.dev', getOption("repos"))
)
```

### Installing Rust

If your operating system or version of R is not installed, you must have
the [Rust compiler](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) installed
to compile this package from sources. After the package is compiled,
Rust is no longer required, and can be safely uninstalled.

#### Installing Rust on Linux or Mac:

To install Rust on Linux or Mac, you can simply run the following
snippet in your terminal.

``` sh
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

#### Installing Rust on Windows:

To install Rust on windows, you can use the Rust installation wizard,
`rustup-init.exe`, found [at this
site](https://forge.rust-lang.org/infra/other-installation-methods.html).
Depending on your version of Windows, you may see an error that looks
something like this:

    error: toolchain 'stable-x86_64-pc-windows-gnu' is not installed

In this case, you should run
`rustup install stable-x86_64-pc_windows-gnu` to install the missing
toolchain. If you’re missing another toolchain, simply type this in the
place of `stable-x86_64-pc_windows-gnu` in the command above.

### Installing Package from Github:

Once you have rust installed Rust, you should be able to install the
package with either the install.packages function as above, or using the
`install_github` function from the `devtools` package or with the
`pkg_install` function from the `pak` package.

``` r
## Install with devtools
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("beniaminogreen/zoomerjoin")

## Install with pak
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pkg_install("beniaminogreen/zoomerjoin")
```

### Loading The Package

Once the package is installed, you can load it into memory as usual by
typing:

``` r
library(zoomerjoin)
```

## Usage:

The flagship feature of zoomerjoins are the jaccard_join and euclidean
family of functions, which are designed to be near drop-ins for the
corresponding dplyr/fuzzyjoin commands:

- `jaccard_left_join()`
- `jaccard_right_join()`
- `jaccard_inner_join()`
- `jaccard_full_join()`
- `euclidean_left_join()`
- `euclidean_right_join()`
- `euclidean_inner_join()`
- `euclidean_full_join()`

The `jaccard_join` family of functions provide fast fuzzy-joins for
strings using the Jaccard distance while the `euclidean_join` family
provides fuzzy-joins for points or vectors using the Euclidean distance.

### Example: Joining rows of the Database on Ideology, Money in Politics, and Elections

(DIME)

Here’s a snippet showing off how to use the `jaccard_inner_join()` merge
two lists of political donors in the [Database on Ideology, Money in
Politics, and Elections (DIME)](https://data.stanford.edu/dime). You can
see a more detailed example of this vignette in the [introductory
vignette](https://beniamino.org/zoomerjoin/articles/guided_tour.html).

I start with two corpuses I would like to combine, `corpus_1`:

``` r
corpus_1 <- dime_data %>%
  head(500)
names(corpus_1) <- c("a", "field")
corpus_1
```

Both corpuses have an observation ID column, and a donor name column. We
would like to join the two datasets on the donor names column, but the
two can’t be directly joined because of misspellings. Because of this,
we will use the jaccard_inner_join function to fuzzily join the two on
the donor name column.

Importantly, Locality Sensitive Hashing is a [probabilistic
algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_algorithm), so it
may fail to identify some matches by random chance. I adjust the
hyperparameters `n_bands` and `band_width` until the chance of true
matches being dropped is negligible. By default, the package will issue
a warning if the chance of a true match being discovered is less than
95%. You can use the `jaccard_probability` and
`jaccard_hyper_grid_search` to help understand the probability any true
matches will be discarded by the algorithm.

More details and a more thorough description of how to tune the
hyperparameters can be can be found in the [guided tour
vignette](https://beniamino.org/zoomerjoin/articles/guided_tour.html).

``` r
set.seed(1)
start_time <- Sys.time()
join_out <- jaccard_inner_join(corpus_1, corpus_2, n_gram_width = 6, n_bands = 20, band_width = 6)
```

    ## Warning in jaccard_join(a, b, mode = "inner", by = by, salt_by = block_by, : A pair of records at the threshold (0.7) have only a 92% chance of being compared.
    ## Please consider changing `n_bands` and `band_width`.

    ## Joining by 'field'

``` r
print(Sys.time() - start_time)
```

    ## Time difference of 0.03253984 secs

``` r
print(join_out)
```

Zoomerjoin is able to quickly find the matching columns without
comparing all pairs of records. This saves more and more time as the
size of each list increases, so it can scale to join datasets with
millions or hundreds of millions of rows.
