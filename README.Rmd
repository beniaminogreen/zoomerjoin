zoomerjoin is an R package that empowers you to fuzzy-join massive datasets
rapidly, and with little memory consumption. Its backbone is a high-performance
implementation of [MinHash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MinHash), an
algorithm which shortcuts the expensive computational step of comparing all
possible pairings of records between the two datasets. In practice, this means
zoomerjoin can fuzzily-join datasets days, or even years faster than other
matching packages. zoomerjoin has been used in-production to join datasets of
hundreds of millions of names in a few hours.

## Installation

---

### Preliminaries - Installing Rust:

You must have [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) installed to
compile this package. After the package is compiled, Rust is no longer
required, and can be safely uninstalled.

To install Rust on windows, you can use the Rust installation wizard, found
[here](https://forge.rust-lang.org/infra/other-installation-methods.html). On
Linux or MacOs, you can install Rust with:

``` sh
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

### Installing Package from Github:

Once you have rust installed Rust, you should be able to install the package
with the `install_github` function from the `devtools` package:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("beniaminogreen/zoomerjoin")
```

## Loading The Package

Load the package by typing

```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(zoomerjoin)
```

### Usage:

The flagship feature of zoomerjoins are the jaccard_join family of functions, which
are designed to be near drop-ins for the corresponding dplyr/fuzzyjoin
commands:

* `jaccard_left_join()`
* `jaccard_right_join()`
* `jaccard_inner_join()`
* `jaccard_full_join()`

Here's a snippet showing off how to use the `lhs_inner_join()` merge two
datasets of political donors in the [Database on Ideology, Money in Politics,
and Elections (DIME)](https://data.stanford.edu/dime). You can see a more
detailed example of this vignette in the [introductory vignette](https://beniaminogreen.github.io/zoomerjoin/articles/guided_tour.html).

I start with two corpuses I would like to combine, `corpus_1`:

```{r}
corpus_1
```

And `corpus_2`:

```{r}
corpus_2
```

Both corpuses have an observation ID column, and a donor name column. We would
like to join the two datasets on the donor names column, but the two can't be
directly joined because of misspellings. Because of this, we will use the
jaccard_inner_join function to fuzzily join the two on the donor name column.

```{r}
start_time <- Sys.time()
join_out <- jaccard_inner_join(corpus_1, corpus_2, n_gram_width=6, n_bands=20, band_width=6)
print(Sys.time() - start_time)
print(join_out)
```

ZoomerJoin finds and joins on the matching rows in just a few seconds.
