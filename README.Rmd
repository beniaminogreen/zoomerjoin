zoomerjoin is an R package that empowers you to fuzzy-join massive datasets
rapidly, and with little memory consumption. It is powered by high-performance
implementations of [Locality Sensitive
Hashing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locality-sensitive_hashing), an
algorithm that finds the matches records between two datasets without having to
compare all possible pairs of observations. In practice, this means zoomerjoin
can fuzzily-join datasets days, or even years faster than other matching
packages. zoomerjoin has been used in-production to join datasets of hundreds
of millions of names in a few hours.

## Installation

---

### Preliminaries - Installing Rust:

You must have the [Rust compiler](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
installed to compile this package. After the package is compiled, Rust is no
longer required, and can be safely uninstalled.

To install Rust on windows, you can use the Rust installation wizard, found
[here](https://forge.rust-lang.org/infra/other-installation-methods.html). On
Linux or MacOs, you can install Rust with:

``` sh
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

### Installing Package from Github:

Once you have rust installed Rust, you should be able to install the package
with the `install_github` function from the `devtools` package, or with the
`pkg_install` function from the `pak` package.

``` r
## Install with devtools
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("beniaminogreen/zoomerjoin")

## Install with pak
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pkg_install("beniaminogreen/zoomerjoin")
```

## Loading The Package

Once the package is installed, you can load it into memory as usual by typing:

```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(zoomerjoin)
```

### Usage:

The flagship feature of zoomerjoins are the jaccard_join and euclidean family
of functions, which are designed to be near drop-ins for the corresponding
dplyr/fuzzyjoin commands:

* `jaccard_left_join()`
* `jaccard_right_join()`
* `jaccard_inner_join()`
* `jaccard_full_join()`
* `euclidean_left_join`
* `euclidean_right_join`
* `euclidean_inner_join`
* `euclidean_full_join`

The `jaccard_join` family of functions provide fast fuzzy-joins for strings
using the Jaccard distance while the `euclidean_join` family provides
fuzzy-joins for points or vectors using the Euclidean distance.

#### Example: Joining rows of the Database on Ideology, Money in Politics, and Elections
(DIME)

Here's a snippet showing off how to use the `lhs_inner_join()` merge two
datasets of political donors in the [Database on Ideology, Money in Politics,
and Elections (DIME)](https://data.stanford.edu/dime). You can see a more
detailed example of this vignette in the [introductory vignette](https://beniaminogreen.github.io/zoomerjoin/articles/guided_tour.html).

I start with two corpuses I would like to combine, `corpus_1`:

```{r}
corpus_1
```

And `corpus_2`:

```{r}
corpus_2
```
Both corpuses have an observation ID column, and a donor name column. We would
like to join the two datasets on the donor names column, but the two can't be
directly joined because of misspellings. Because of this, we will use the
jaccard_inner_join function to fuzzily join the two on the donor name column.

Importantly, Locality Sensitive Hashing is a [probabilistic
algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_algorithm), so it may fail
to identify some matches by random chance. I adjust the hyperparameters
`n_bands` and `band_width` until the chance of true matches being dropped is
negligible. By default, the package will issue a warning if the chance of a
true match being discovered is less than 95%. You can use the
`jaccard_probability` and `jaccard_hyper_grid_search` to help understand the
probability any true matches will be discarded by the algorithm.

More details and a more thorough description of how to tune the hyperparameters can be can be found
in the [guided tour vignette](https://beniaminogreen.github.io/zoomerjoin/articles/guided_tour.html).

```{r}
start_time <- Sys.time()
join_out <- jaccard_inner_join(corpus_1, corpus_2, n_gram_width=6, n_bands=20, band_width=6)
print(Sys.time() - start_time)
print(join_out)
```

ZoomerJoin finds and joins on the matching rows in just a few seconds.
